# Distributed Key-Value Store with Consistent Hashing

A Python implementation of a distributed key-value store featuring consistent hashing, replication, and fault tolerance.

## Features

- ✅ **Consistent Hashing** with virtual nodes for balanced distribution
- ✅ **N-way Replication** for data durability and availability  
- ✅ **Dynamic Node Management** - add/remove nodes at runtime
- ✅ **Fault Tolerance** - system continues operating during node failures
- ✅ **Thread-safe Operations** - concurrent client support
- ✅ **CLI Client** - easy-to-use command-line interface
